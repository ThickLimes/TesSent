# TesSent
For MSDS 498 Capstone course. This is the code for the TesSent application. This application runs in the AWS and it performs sentinment analysis of messages from Twitter. It relies primarily upon managed tools as opposed to open source tools. The tweet_grab.py file uses to sets of credentials (one for Twitter and one for AWS) to touch the Twitter API to begin receiving tweets that are filtered to only be tweets containing "Tesla". These tweets are then delivered to a Kinesis Firehose which is an event streaming data pipe. This Firehouse also runs a Lambda (serverless event based computing system) to call Comprehend to extract the sentiment from the tweet. The code for the Lambda is contained in the lambda file. The tweet is then tagged with a date and sent to the S3 database in a json format. The S3 database store tweets as objects. Athena then is able to extract the data from the S3 and convert that to a table. Tableau then is used to visualize the data from the table.
